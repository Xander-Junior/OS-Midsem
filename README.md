# Operating System Midsemester Project: Memory Management System

## Project Overview
Welcome to our repository for the Operating System midsemester project. Our goal is to design and implement a basic memory management system using paging written in C. This project allows us to dive deep into the foundational concepts of operating systems, including address spaces, address translation, paging, and the simulation of processes accessing memory. We aim to not only implement these concepts but also to analyze and optimize our system for enhanced memory efficiency and performance.

## Objectives
- Understand the concepts of address spaces, address translation, and paging.
- Implement a memory management system that utilizes paging techniques.
- Simulate process memory access and observe the system's paging behaviour.
- Analyze the memory utilization, page faults, and hit rates under different scenarios.
- Optimize the system using various page replacement algorithms and compare their effectiveness.

We are a group of students enthusiastic about exploring the intricacies of operating systems and committed to applying theoretical knowledge to practical challenges.

## Implementation
The project is structured into several key components:
1. **Memory Spaces Definition**: Define the size of virtual and physical memory spaces.
2. **Paging System Design**: Implement data structures for page tables and physical memory frames.
3. **Address Translation**: Develop functions for translating virtual addresses to physical addresses.
4. **Process Simulation**: Simulate processes accessing memory and manage page allocation and deallocation.
5. **Page Fault Handling**: Implement mechanisms for handling page faults efficiently.
6. **Performance Analysis**: Analyze and optimize the system based on memory utilization and page fault rates.

## Technologies
- **Programming Language**: C
- **Development Tools**: GCC for compilation, GDB for debugging
